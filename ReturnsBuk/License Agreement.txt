Software End User License Agreement
This Software End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is between you (both the individual
installing the Program and any single legal entity for which the individual is acting) ("You" or
"Your") and PIONEER CORPORATION ("Pioneer").
TAKING ANY STEP TO SET UP OR INSTALL THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENSE AGREEMENT. PERMISSION TO DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THE PROGRAM IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED ON YOUR
FOLLOWING THESE TERMS. WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC APPROVAL IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS AGREEMENT VALID
AND ENFORCEABLE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED
TO USE THE PROGRAM AND MUST STOP INSTALLING IT OR UNINSTALL IT, AS APPLICABLE.
1. DEFINITIONS
1.1 "Documentation" means written documentation, specifications and help content made generally
available by Pioneer to aid in installing and using the Program.
1.2 "Program" means all or any part of Pioneer's software licensed to You by Pioneer under this
Agreement.
2. PROGRAM LICENSE
2.1 Limited License. Subject to this Agreement's restrictions, Pioneer grants to You a limited,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, license (without the right to sublicense):
(a) To install a single copy of the Program on the hard disk drive of Your computer, to use the
Program only for Your personal purpose complying with this Agreement and the Documentation
("Authorized Use");
(b) To use the Documentation in support of Your Authorized Use; and
(c) To make one copy of the Program solely for backup purposes, provided that all titles and
trademark, copyright and restricted rights notices are reproduced on the copy.
2.2 Restrictions. You will not copy or use the Program or Documentation except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement. You will not transfer, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Program, or
use it for third-party training, commercial time-sharing or service bureau use. You will not
Yourself or through any third party modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Program,
except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, and then only after You have notified
Pioneer in writing of Your intended activities. You will not use the Program on multiple processors
without Pioneer's prior written consent.
2.3 Ownership. Pioneer or its licensor retains all right, title and interest in and to all patent,
copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Program and
Documentation, and any derivative works thereof. You do not acquire any other rights, express or
implied, beyond the limited license set forth in this Agreement.
2.4 No Support. Pioneer has no obligation to provide support, maintenance, upgrades, modifications
or new releases for the Program or Documentation under this Agreement.
3. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
THE PROGRAM AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND
YOU AGREE TO USE THEM AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, PIONEER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND DOCUMENTATION,
WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR
USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
4. DAMAGES AND REMEDIES FOR BREACH
You agree that any breach of this Agreement's restrictions would cause Pioneer irreparable harm for
which money damages alone would be inadequate. In addition to damages and any other remedies to
which Pioneer may be entitled, You agree that Pioneer may seek injunctive relief to prevent the
actual, threatened or continued breach of this Agreement.
5. TERMINATION
Pioneer may terminate this Agreement at any time upon Your breach of any provision. If this
Agreement is terminated, You will stop using the Program, permanently delete it from the computer
where it resides, and destroy all copies of the Program and Documentation in Your possession,
confirming to Pioneer in writing that You have done so. Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will
continue in effect after this Agreement's termination.
6. GENERAL TERMS
6.1 Limitation of Liability. In no event will Pioneer or its subsidiaries be liable in connection
with this Agreement or its subject matter, under any theory of liability, for any indirect,
incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or damages for lost profits, revenue,
business, savings, data, use, or cost of substitute procurement, even if advised of the possibility
of such damages or if such damages are foreseeable. In no event will Pioneer's liability for all
damages exceed the amounts actually paid by You to Pioneer or its subsidiaries for the Program. The
parties acknowledge that the liability limits and risk allocation in this Agreement are reflected
in the Program price and are essential elements of the bargain between the parties, without which
Pioneer would not have provided the Program or entered into this Agreement.
6.2 The limitations or exclusions of warranties and liability contained in this Agreement do not
affect or prejudice Your statutory rights as consumer and shall apply to You only to the extent
such limitations or exclusions are permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where You are
located.
6.3 Severability and Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
otherwise unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the extent possible or, if incapable of
enforcement, deemed to be severed and deleted from this Agreement, and the remainder will continue
in full force and effect. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement
will not waive any other or subsequent default or breach.
6.4 No Assignment. You may not assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of this
Agreement or any rights or obligations under it, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation
of law or otherwise, without Pioneer's prior written consent. Any purported assignment, transfer or
delegation by You will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding
upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
6.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, whether written or oral,
concerning its subject matter. This Agreement may not be modified or amended without Pioneer's
prior and express written consent, and no other act, document, usage or custom will be deemed to
amend or modify this Agreement.
6.6 You agree that this Agreement shall be governed and construed by and under the laws of Japan.
